- Multi-timeline support (primary/secondary activities, location, social context, etc.)
- Hierarchical activity categories with color coding
- Mobile-responsive design with touch support - [view layouts](responsive-layouts.md)

- **Frontend:** Pure client-side JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Data Storage:** OSF via JSPsych DataPipe
- **Deployment:** Static hosting (GitHub Pages, etc.)

## Research Applications

O-ELIDDI is particularly suitable for:

- Time-use studies and activity pattern research
- Daily diary studies in psychology and sociology
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Experience sampling method (ESM) studies
- Cross-cultural time-use comparisons
- Intervention studies measuring activity changes

## Browser Requirements
