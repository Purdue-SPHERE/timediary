[← Back to Documentation Home](index.md)

## Overview

The Open Science Framework (OSF) provides a robust, free platform for research data management. Combined with JSPsych DataPipe, it offers secure, automated data collection for O-ELIDDI studies with built-in research best practices.

### Key Benefits

| **Free & Open** | **Secure** | **Research-Ready** | **Automatic** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Completely free for academic research with unlimited storage and no participant limits. | Data encrypted in transit and at rest, with granular access controls and audit trails. | Built-in version control, metadata management, and collaboration tools for research teams. | No server setup required - data flows automatically from your study to OSF storage. |

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] An OSF account (free at osf.io)
- [ ] A deployed O-ELIDDI study (see GitHub Pages Deployment guide)
- [ ] Basic understanding of your study's data collection needs
- [ ] Institutional ethics approval (if required)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create OSF Account

If you don't already have an OSF account:

1. Visit [osf.io](https://osf.io)
2. Click **"Sign Up"**
3. Use your institutional email address if available
4. Verify your email address
5. Complete your profile with research information

> **Tip:** Using an institutional email helps establish credibility and may provide access to additional OSF features.

### 2. Create a New OSF Project

Set up a project to organize your study data:

1. Log into OSF and click **"Create new project"**
2. Enter a descriptive project title (e.g., "Daily Activity Patterns Study 2024")
3. Add a project description including:
   - Study objectives and research questions
   - Participant demographics and recruitment
   - Data collection timeline
   - Analysis plan overview
4. Set appropriate access permissions:
   - **Public:** For open science projects
   - **Private:** For sensitive data (can be made public later)
5. Add relevant tags and subjects for discoverability

### 3. Access JSPsych DataPipe

Set up automated data collection through DataPipe:

1. Visit [pipe.jspsych.org](https://pipe.jspsych.org)
2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Sign in with your OSF credentials
4. Authorize DataPipe to access your OSF account

> **Authorization:** DataPipe needs access to create files in your OSF projects. This is secure and only allows DataPipe to upload data files to projects you specify.

### 4. Create DataPipe Experiment

Configure DataPipe for your O-ELIDDI study:

1. In DataPipe dashboard, click **"Create Experiment"**
2. Enter experiment details:
   - **Name:** Match your OSF project name
   - **Description:** Brief description of data being collected
   - **OSF Project:** Select the project you created in Step 2
3. Configure data settings:
   - **Data format:** CSV (default, recommended for O-ELIDDI)
   - **File naming:** Use default pattern
   - **Storage location:** Confirm correct OSF project
4. Click **"Create Experiment"**
5. **Important:** Copy the generated **Experiment ID** - you'll need this for O-ELIDDI configuration

> **Experiment ID Example:** Your ID will look something like `eR8ENvJPgQth` - save this securely as it's required for data collection.

### 5. Configure O-ELIDDI

Connect your study to DataPipe by updating the configuration:

1. Open your O-ELIDDI repository (locally or on GitHub)
2. Edit `settings/activities.json`
3. Update the `experimentID` field in the `general` section:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "experimentID": "YOUR_DATAPIPE_EXPERIMENT_ID",
    "app_name": "Your Study Name",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "language": "en",
    "instructions": true,
    "primary_redirect_url": "pages/thank-you.html",
    "fallbackToCSV": true
  },
  // ... rest of configuration
}
```

> **Important:** Replace `YOUR_DATAPIPE_EXPERIMENT_ID` with the actual ID from Step 4. Keep `fallbackToCSV: true` for backup data collection.

### 6. Test Data Collection

Verify that data flows correctly from your study to OSF:

1. Deploy your updated O-ELIDDI configuration
2. Complete a test timeline on your deployed study
3. Submit the data and note any error messages
4. Check your OSF project for the uploaded data file
5. Download and examine the CSV to verify data format

#### Successful Test Indicators

- ✅ No error messages during data submission
- ✅ Automatic redirect to thank you page
- ✅ CSV file appears in OSF project within minutes
- ✅ File contains expected timeline data and metadata

## Data Management on OSF

### File Organization

DataPipe automatically organizes your files in the OSF project:

- **Folder structure:** Files are typically stored in the main project directory
- **File naming:** `timeline_{participantID}_{timestamp}.csv`
- **Automatic versioning:** OSF tracks all file changes and versions

### Accessing Your Data

#### Via OSF Web Interface

1. Log into OSF and navigate to your project
2. Click **"Files"** tab
3. Browse and download individual files or entire folders
4. Use built-in preview for CSV files

#### Via API Access

For automated data processing, use OSF's API:

```python
# Python example using requests
import requests

# Get project files
project_id = "YOUR_OSF_PROJECT_ID"
url = f"https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/{project_id}/files/osfstorage/"
response = requests.get(url)

# Download specific file
file_download_url = "DIRECT_FILE_URL_FROM_API"
data = requests.get(file_download_url).content
```

### Data Backup and Security

- **Automatic backups:** OSF maintains multiple copies of your data
- **Version history:** All file versions are preserved
- **Access logs:** Track who accessed what data when
- **Export options:** Download entire projects as ZIP files

## Privacy and Ethics Configuration

### Project Visibility Settings

**Visibility Options:**
- **Private:** Only you and collaborators can access (recommended for active data collection)
- **Public:** Visible to everyone (consider for post-publication data sharing)
- **Embargoed:** Public metadata, private data until a specified date

### Ethical Considerations

Before collecting data, ensure:

- [ ] Institutional ethics approval is obtained
- [ ] Participant consent procedures are documented
- [ ] Data anonymization protocols are in place
- [ ] Data retention policies are established
- [ ] Access permissions are properly configured
- [ ] Compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

### Data Anonymization

O-ELIDDI can collect anonymous data by design:

- **No personal information:** Timeline data contains no inherently identifying information
- **Participant IDs:** Use anonymous codes rather than names or email addresses
- **URL parameters:** Avoid including sensitive information in participant links
- **IP addresses:** Not collected by O-ELIDDI or stored in timeline data

## Collaboration and Team Management

### Adding Team Members

1. In your OSF project, click **"Contributors"**
2. Click **"Add"** and enter collaborator email addresses
3. Set appropriate permission levels:
   - **Administrator:** Full project control
   - **Read + Write:** Can view and upload data
   - **Read:** View-only access
4. Send invitations and manage access as needed

### DataPipe Access Management

> **DataPipe Security:** Only the OSF account holder who created the DataPipe experiment can modify its settings. Team members access data through OSF project permissions, not DataPipe directly.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### DataPipe Dashboard

Monitor your data collection through the DataPipe interface:

- **Upload statistics:** Number of successful uploads
- **Error logs:** Details of any failed uploads
- **Recent activity:** Timeline of data submissions
- **Storage usage:** Amount of data collected

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Data Not Appearing in OSF

- Check experimentID is correct in activities.json
- Verify OSF project permissions
- Look for error messages in browser console
- Check DataPipe dashboard for upload errors
- Wait up to 5 minutes for processing delays

#### Authentication Errors

- Reauthorize DataPipe in your OSF account settings
- Check that the OSF project still exists
- Verify you have write permissions to the project
- Try creating a test experiment with a new project

### Debugging Data Collection

#### Browser Console Testing

Test DataPipe connectivity directly in browser console:

```javascript
// Check if data would be sent successfully
console.log(window.timelineManager.study);

// Test DataPipe endpoint (replace with your experiment ID)
fetch('https://pipe.jspsych.org/api/data/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
    body: JSON.stringify({
        experimentID: 'YOUR_EXPERIMENT_ID',
        filename: 'test.csv',
        data: 'test,data\n1,2'
    })
}).then(response => console.log(response));
```

## Data Analysis Preparation

### Batch Data Download

For analysis, download all participant data at once:

1. In OSF project, go to **Files** tab
2. Select all data files (Ctrl+click or Shift+click)
3. Click **Download** to get a ZIP file
4. Extract CSV files for analysis

### Data Aggregation Scripts

#### Python Example

```python
import pandas as pd
import glob
import os

# Read all CSV files from download
csv_files = glob.glob("downloaded_data/*.csv")
all_data = []

for file in csv_files:
    df = pd.read_csv(file)
    all_data.append(df)

# Combine all participant data
combined_data = pd.concat(all_data, ignore_index=True)

# Save master dataset
combined_data.to_csv("master_timeline_data.csv", index=False)
```

### Quality Control Checks

Recommended data quality checks:

- [ ] Verify all expected participants have submitted data
- [ ] Check for duplicate submissions
- [ ] Validate timeline coverage completeness
- [ ] Review timestamp formatting and ranges
- [ ] Identify any unusual activity patterns
- [ ] Check URL parameter data for accuracy
